# Chinese Checkers in OCaml

This project is an OCaml-based implementation of Chinese Checkers.  
It includes functions to define the board, handle moves (single steps and jumps), check validity, update the configuration, compute scores, and determine if a player has won.

## Features
- Data structures representing the hexagonal board and pieces.
- Functions for validating moves, applying moves, and updating the game state.
- Support for multiple players and colors.
- A scoring system to track progression.
- Basic strategies like a greedy move selection.
- Simple printing functions to visualize the game board in the terminal.

## Getting Started
1. **Dependencies**:  
   - OCaml and its standard tools.
   
2. **Compilation**:  
   Run `ocamlc -o checkers code.ml` (adjust as needed based on your OCaml setup).

3. **Running**:  
   Execute `./checkers` to start the program. Modify the code as needed to set initial configurations or start specific scenarios.

## Additional Details
For more in-depth explanations of the functions, data structures, and logic, please refer to the accompanying PDF file, which describes the projectâ€™s questions and approaches.
